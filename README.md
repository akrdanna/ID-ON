# ID-ON
First rhythm mobile game!

Uses a revolutionary cross-shaped two-lane system, guaranteed to mess with the player's mind.

Originally, I built this to support Indonesian (local) EDM artists, who make this kind of music. This is why I used Vice Versa by Raphiiel as my initial/trial song. 
Furthermore, I wanted to know the mechanics of rhythm games and game design in general since I'm very interested in creating sounds for games (I currently study sound design).

It will use a pack system and characters with different skills, similar to Arcaea.

First built with Unity 2019.4, then switched to Unity 2020.3.0f1.

Inspirations:
Arcaea, Muse Dash, Bang Dream
